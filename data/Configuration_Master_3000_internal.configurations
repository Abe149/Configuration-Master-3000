*␟Configuration Master 3000␟port number␟4430 # 4430 is the hard-coded default for all MLs, so this line is redundant until edited

# as of this writing, setting the above to anything other than 4430 [in ML 0] will break the dynamic testing,
# i.e. the tests in "/Q_and_D_dynamic_tester.bash": both the Bash tests that are in that file itself,
# and the Python3 tests that it "drives", i.e. as of this writing:
#   /Python3_sources/Configuration_Master_client/test_001_.py
#   /Python3_sources/Configuration_Master_client/test_002_.py
#   /Python3_sources/Configuration_Master_client/test_003_.py
