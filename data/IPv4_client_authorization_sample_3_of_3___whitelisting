strategy whitelisting # This means that whitelisting rules are acceptable in this file.

                      # Although -- _technically_ -- whitelisting rules are not required in this file,
                      #   in the absence of any such rules, the engine will label _all_ connections
                      #   as unauthorized.

                      # All the requirements are still processed, same is in the other strategy modes,
                      #   so if _none_ of your whitelisting rules meet the requirements of _all_
                      #   of the requirements stated in "require" statements, then, as above,
                      #   the engine will label _all_ connections as unauthorized...  as required.  ;-)

# _NO_ regex symbols are allowed/recognized/{handled specially} in FQDN literals, so a period is handled as a _literal_ period
whitelist FQDN literal localhost # this works

whitelist FQDN literal loca.host # this should _not_ work, since in an FQDN literal the '.' character is _not_ "magical", unlike in an FQDN _pattern_

whitelist FQDN literal this.is.a.test.of.the.emergency.broadcast.system


# whitelist FQDN pattern localhost     # this works
# whitelist FQDN pattern local.*host   # this works too

# whitelist FQDN pattern ^localhost$   # this works too
# whitelist FQDN pattern .*localhost.* # this works too
# whitelist FQDN pattern .*ocalhos.* # this works too
# whitelist FQDN pattern .*local.*host.* # this works too
