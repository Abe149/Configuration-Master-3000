strategy whitelisting # This means that whitelisting rules are acceptable in this file.

                      # Although -- _technically_ -- whitelisting rules are not required in this file,
                      #   in the absence of any such rules, the engine will label _all_ connections
                      #   as unauthorized.

                      # All the requirements are still processed, same is in the other strategy modes,
                      #   so if _none_ of your whitelisting rules meet the requirements of _all_
                      #   of the requirements stated in "require" statements, then, as above,
                      #   the engine will label _all_ connections as unauthorized...  as required.  ;-)
