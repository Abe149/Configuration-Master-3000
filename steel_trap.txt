A POSSIBLE LACK OF STRICTNESS, EVEN IN STRICT-CHECKING MODE: since the code below checks for conflicts using the string repr
esentations after a _complete_ "unparse" of the relevant internal datum, not only can it not disambiguate between data with differe
nt types but the same values [e.g.: a URL with the value "http://example.com/" vs. a _string_ with the value "http://example.com/", a positive integer with the value 1 vs. a nonnegative integer with the value 1], but it _also_ cannot disambiguate between a positive integer with the value 1 and a string with the value "1" [w/o the quotes], and therefor will consider all those "could be viewe
d as conflicting" scenarios as "OK, just redundant"; perhaps TO DO about this: enable/implement multiple _levels_ of strictness, an
d if/when e.g. strictness>1 then check for these conflicts [i.e. type conflicts even when the values are either identical or "look the same" (i.e. 1 vs. "1")]
