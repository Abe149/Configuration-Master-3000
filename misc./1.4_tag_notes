Added the ability of the CM3000 server to have its own port number to be configured using the CM3000 engine, i.e. "eating its own dog food", including the ability of the CM3000 server`s port number to be "sensitive" to the ML that the server detects that it itself {should be / is} running within, which may be from an env. var. or from a file; in the Bash client: added much-better detection/finding/defaulting of the ML and the server URL; in the Python client: added much-better detection/finding/defaulting of the ML and the server URL; the server, the Bash client, and the Python client all now potentially read from "/etc/Configuration_Master_3000/maturity_level" [if the relevant env. var. -- CONFIG_MATURITY_LEVEL -- is unset/{set to empty}/{contains unacceptable contents, e.g./i.e. a negative number}]; the Bash client, and the Python client both now potentially read from "/etc/Configuration_Master_3000/server_URL" [if the relevant env. var. -- CONFIG_SERVER_URL -- is unset/{set to empty}]
